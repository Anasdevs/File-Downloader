## Limitations

Please note that this application may not be able to download files from certain websites, such as Instagram YouTube etc. This limitation is due to the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy implemented by those websites. CORS is a security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.

As a result, you might encounter issues when attempting to download files from websites that have strict CORS policies in place. The application may not be able to access the necessary resources to initiate the download.
